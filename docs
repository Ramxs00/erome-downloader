    Create a Window:
        Initialize your GUI window with a title, size, and layout.

    Add Input Fields:
        Create an entry field for the user to input the erome.com URL.
        Add a directory selection option to specify where downloads should be saved.

    Add Buttons:
        Create a "Download" button to start the downloading process.
        Optionally, add a "Cancel" button to allow users to stop the download.

    Add Output Area:
        Include a text area or label to display messages or progress updates.

Step 3: Implement Download Functionality

    Set Up Event Handling:
        Connect the "Download" button to an event handler that retrieves the input URL and download location.
    Call the Gallery-dl Function:
        Use the gallery-dl command to start downloading the content from the provided URL.
        You may need to run the gallery-dl command in a subprocess to avoid blocking the GUI.

Step 4: Handle Progress and Output

    Display Progress:
        Update the GUI with progress messages (e.g., "Downloading...", "Completed") as the download proceeds.
    Handle Errors:
        Implement error handling to catch any issues during the download process and display error messages in the output area.
